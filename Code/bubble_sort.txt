Bubble Sort

When we consider a data collection to be sorted using Bubble Sort, this implies that algorithm will require maximum n-1
passes and [n(n-1)]/2 comparisons for a data collection to get sorted. The algorithm sorts a data collection in such a
way that at 1st pass the greatest element in the collection reaches at end position, similarly for pass 2, 2nd greatest
element reaches at 2nd last position in the collection and likewise other elements are sorted. The movement of elements
is done by pair to pair checking of elements and if they are in undesired order they are shuffled. It is more suitable
for small lists.
