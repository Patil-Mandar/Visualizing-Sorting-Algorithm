Insertion Sort


In case of Insertion Sort, the algorithm builds final sorting list by transferring one element at a time and the
algorithm requires maximum n-1 passes and (n-1)/4n comparisons for a data collection to get sorted. It considers
the 1st element of the data collection as sorted, then all other elements are one by one compared with that element
and every element is inserted as per its value in the sorted list. If compared to bubble sort, Insertion sort is
twice as fast as it.
