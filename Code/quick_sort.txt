Quick Sort

Quick Sort also known as Divide and conquer algorithm as it picks an element as pivot and partitions the given data
collection around the picked pivot. Inside Quick Sort major processing is done by Partition function, where we keep the
track of last smallest element (w.r.t. Pivot element) of data collection with a variable and we keep the track of first
greatest element (w.r.t. Pivot element) of data collection by using another variable. And after every pass Pivot element
is brought to its sorted position i.e., all, elements on its left are smaller than it and all elements on right are
greater. Further the data collection is divided into two fragments and again the quick sort algorithm is applied i.e.,
it calls itself and therefore it is a recursive algorithm.
